  The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system
  where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource L
  ocators , which may be interlinked by hy
  pertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web
   are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed
   by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published
   by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not syno
   nymous with the Internet, which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two
    decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.
